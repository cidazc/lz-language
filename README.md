#LZ programming language
###A programing language I made for really lazy typers

## Synopsis

Hello there. 2 days ago we were asked to submit a programming language for a class. I made it to for really **lazy** programmers. So I called it **lazy** or **lz**.

I wanted mine to have really lazy keywords, so all the keywords it used are only two letters long. Plus I tried that most of the symbols used, to the best of my ability didn't use the *SHIFT* key.

I hope that this can grow and be developed. I have actually never maintained any large project so this would be my first. Any help would be appreciated.

## Language Syntax



## Number System

Gab Lopez, a friend of mine designed a new phonetic number system since some numbers have 2 syllables or are hard to pronounce. Here is a modified version of his original number system.

wa - 0

oh - 1

to - 2

ti - 3

fo - 4

fi - 5

si - 6

se - 7

ei - 8

ni - 9




## Motivation

I actually made this language to implement the number system above but I realized more people might want to use this language for its imperative laziness.

It is suprisingly a little better at lists than C. It has push, pop, top, a length, and even an isEmpty function. Thanks to Python.

## Installation

**Dependencies:**

*-Python 2.7.15*

*-Linux OS*

*-(optional PLY)*

### For first time github users
To install, clone the git repository to your folder...

It's actually my first time using github as well. But I do want to make this part easy for people who don't know how to use github as well.

## Future Features

I plan to make this a fully fledged language by 2021. But so far I am currently learning everything, this was my first language and even github project as well.

### \t-function implementation
### \t-file reading
### \t-its first standard library
### \t-easier installation, compilation
### \t-its own Jupyter notebook

## Contributors

I have been the only one developing this at this point. If you want to help me develop this language more. Maybe you know how to make a proper compiler or know how to make the grammar better or have ideas on the language or number system please do message me. or email me jjazcarraga@up.edu.ph
